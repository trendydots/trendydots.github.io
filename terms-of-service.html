        In addition to the above, the following provisions shall apply to you if you have opted to subscribe to premium content/functionality on the Sites (collectively, the “Premium Service”).
    </p>
    <p class="mt-1 lg:mt-4 max-w-lg m-auto leading-loose mb-6 text-left">
        6.1 Subscription and Service
        You may not use any portion of the Premium Service without a valid subscription from Trendy Dots. To obtain a subscription, you must register as a paying user on Sites. Your subscription will not be valid unless and until Trendy Dots accepts your registration. By registering for the Premium Service, you represent and warrant that all registration information that you provide is true, complete, and accurate, and you agree to notify Trendy Dots promptly of any changes to this registration information. 
    </p>
    <p class="mt-1 lg:mt-4 max-w-lg m-auto leading-loose mb-6 text-left">
        You may be offered a free trial subscription to the Premium Service, beginning on the date on which Trendy Dots accepts your registration and you will be notified of the length of the trial subscription. If you do not terminate this subscription to the Premium Service during this trial period by notifying Trendy Dots on the email address provided to you at the time you register for the free trial subscription, the initial term of your regular paid Premium Service subscription will start immediately after the free trial period ends, and will continue for the length of time that you selected when you registered.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-1 lg:mt-4 max-w-lg m-auto leading-loose mb-6 text-left">
        You understand that, unless you notify Trendy Dots on the email address provided to you at the time that you register for the Premium Service, that you wish to terminate your Premium Service subscription before the end of your then-current subscription term, your subscription will continue to automatically renew for successive terms of the same duration and your credit card will be charged for each such renewal at the applicable subscription fee in effect at the time of that renewal. In those instances where you took advantage of a special or introductory offer to become a Premium Member, your subscription will automatically renew at Trendy Dots’ then-current subscription fee to the term specified in the offer and your credit card will be charged the subscription fee in effect at the time of that renewal. The term "subscription term" shall refer to the term of your subscription then in effect, regardless of whether it is the initial term or any renewal of that term.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-1 lg:mt-4 max-w-lg m-auto leading-loose mb-6 text-left">
        TRENDY DOTS RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CHANGE THE PREMIUM SERVICE AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ADDING OR REMOVING FEATURES). IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH ANY SUCH CHANGES, OR IF YOU ARE OTHERWISE DISSATISFIED WITH THE PREMIUM SERVICE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ITS PERFORMANCE OR AVAILABILITY), YOUR ONLY REMEDY WILL BE TO CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION, AS SET FORTH BELOW.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-1 lg:mt-4 max-w-lg m-auto leading-loose mb-6 text-left">
        Your subscription is personal to you, and you may not transfer or share your subscription with any other person (including but not limited to your co-workers) other than immediate family members living in the same household, provided that: (i) such family members have read and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions and these Premium User Provisions; (ii) your Premium Service subscription is not simultaneously used by more than one person at any given time; and (iii) you agree to be responsible for any use other than that described in (i) and (ii).

    <p class="mt-1 lg:mt-4 max-w-lg m-auto leading-loose mb-6 text-left">
        6.2 Charges and Billing Practices
        <br/>
        If offered a free trial to the Premium Service, you will not be charged a subscription fee during that free trial period. Subscription Fees on credit-card transactions will be authorized immediately, but not actually processed until the trial period has expired. If you remain a subscriber to the Premium Service (a “Premium Member”) when your free trial period ends, you will be charged for the initial term of your Premium Service subscription and then, at the beginning of each renewal term, if any, you will be charged the then-current Premium Service subscription fee for the term length you selected. Subscription fees will be based upon the subscription rates in effect at the start of each subscription term and will apply whether or not you actually use the Premium Service during that term. You may always find the current retail subscription rates by reviewing the Pricing portion of the Site. Subscription fees are non-refundable, except as set forth below.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-1 lg:mt-4 max-w-lg m-auto leading-loose mb-6 text-left">
        We reserve the right to change the subscription or other fees it charges for products, services or features (collectively, "Products") offered in connection with the Premium Service and/or the Site at any time. These sorts of changes include, but are not limited to, adding fees for new/optional Products and/or modifying fees for existing Products. By using any of the Products with which there are associated fees, you agree to pay those fees and that Trendy Dots may charge your credit card for those fees. If you do not want to pay these associated fees, you must cancel your subscription, as set forth below.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-1 lg:mt-4 max-w-lg m-auto leading-loose mb-6 text-left">
        Subscription fees and all others fees and charges associated with your subscription (including, but not limited to VAT) will be billed automatically to the credit card you provide ("your credit card") when registering for the Premium Service.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-1 lg:mt-4 max-w-lg m-auto leading-loose mb-6 text-left">
          6.3 Cancellation
          <br/>
          You may cancel your subscription by writing to the email address listed below under "Customer Service and Product Support" to notify Trendy Dots. 
    </p>
    <p class="mt-1 lg:mt-4 max-w-lg m-auto leading-loose mb-6 text-left">
        If you cancel your subscription during your free trial period, you will not be responsible for the payment of a subscription fee (but may, as set forth above, be responsible for printing fees associated with your exceeding the Printable Reports minimums). However, except as otherwise provided herein, if you subscribe on an annual or greater basis and you cancel your Premium Service subscription at any time after your trial period expires, your membership will terminate on that date. (For example, if your paid subscription start date is on January 1 and you cancel on June 15, your membership terminates on June 15, at which time it ends.) For persons that subscribe on an annual or greater basis, any remaining prepaid charges will be refunded, prorated on an annual basis, to your credit card after your membership is terminated. If you subscribe on a monthly basis and subsequently cancel your subscription during a month, your subscription will continue to the end of its monthly term and you will be entitled to continue to use the Premium Service until the time of termination.
        Trendy Dots may immediately cancel your subscription, without notice or liability, if it determines in its sole discretion that: (i) you have breached any portion of the terms and conditions or these Premium User Provisions; or (ii) your use of or access to the Premium Service or the Site violates any applicable law or regulation or otherwise inhibits any other subscriber from using or accessing the Premium Service or any other service offered by Trendy Dots on the Site. None of the foregoing limits any other legal, equitable, or contractual rights available to Trendy Dots.
        Trendy Dots may, in its sole discretion, choose not to renew your subscription by sending a notice of non-renewal at any time during your subscription term to the e-mail address you provided when completing your registration or to a new email address where you have notified us of your change in e-mail address. You will be deemed to have received this notice, whether or not you saw it or the email address most recently provided by you continues to be valid. In the event of such a notice, your subscription will cease and will not automatically renew at the end of your then-current subscription term.
