## Running it locally

cd into `stitches-template-generator` and run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will compile the JS, CSS and start a node server on port 3000.

Head to `localhost:3000`. You should see stitches now!

### Docker

You can also run it in Docker.

```
# Build the container
make build

# Run the node server
make run
```

## Make your own templates

Feel free to take this project and re-factor to your need! Not everyone wants these templates for their projects. Here are the steps:

1. Read the [Contributing guideline here](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
2. Run the project locally (see the section above)
3. Head to `localhost:3000`
4. Add your own HTML template (with tailwind.css classes) into the `templates` folder
5. Add a filter button for it in the `index.html`. (i.e. add `<button class="text-black font-semibold hover:text-green px-2 py-1 transition-normal" data-filter="st-<your template name>">Tabs</button>`)
6. Done! refresh to check out your own templates.
