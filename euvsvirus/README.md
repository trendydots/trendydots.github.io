## Inspiration

Around Europe, there are countless culinary fairs where food and culture combine the joy of experiencing new tastes with the knowledge and customs of the region. During times of isolation, experiencing such events is impossible.

## What it does

Bites of Culture is a smart calendar system that shows users culinary and cultural snippets from the European regions they choose to follow. Each culinary bite describes the local custom around the traditional meal, or ingredient.

City councils provide their calendar of fairs and local producers provide their products that would otherwise be sold in the fair. Bites of Culture include links to online grocery shops with the capacity to distribute the locally produced goods in all Europe.

Thus, Bites of Culture not only distributes knowledge, but also allows users all over Europe to experience bits of other countries traditions within the same periods. This also means the purchased products are most likely seasonal and can be offered in a sustainable way.
